## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


Loading of packages required for the data analysis
```{r packages, echo=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readr")
```


Loading of data into R
```{r raw_statistics}
raw_stats <- read.csv("~/Documents/Class/CKME-136/Workshop/all_energy_statistics.csv")
```


We now look at the data loaded
```{r data_examination}
View(raw_stats)
```


Looking further:
```{r}
summary(raw_stats)

str(raw_stats)

anyNA(raw_stats$quantity_footnotes)

sum(is.na(raw_stats$quantity_footnotes))

ncol(raw_stats)

nrow(raw_stats)

```



Dataset is 7 columns x 1,189,482 rows. Lots of N/A's in "quantity footnotes variable". Check to see how many.
```{r}
(sum(is.na(raw_stats$quantity_footnotes))/nrow(raw_stats))*100
```
